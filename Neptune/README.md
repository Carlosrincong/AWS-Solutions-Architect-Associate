A graph database is a good choice for highly connected data with a rich variety of relationships.  for applications that work with highly connected datasets. 
Neptune offers read replicas in multtiple AZ for highly availability (max 15)
Companies often use graph databases for recommendation engines, fraud detection, and knowledge graphs.

for highly connected datasets

A knowledge graph allows you to store information in a graph model and use graph queries to enable your users to easily navigate highly connected datasets.

The client application then uses simple SPARQL queries to build graphical visualizations.

optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency.

non-relational

identify common data points between nodes.
navigate relationships
