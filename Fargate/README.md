# AWS Fargate
![Fargate](/img/serverless.jpg)

Fargate abstracts the EC2 instance so that youâ€™re not required to manage the underlying compute infrastructure.
AWS Fargate is a purpose-built serverless compute engine for containers. AWS Fargate scales and manages the infrastructure, so developers can work on what they do best, application development.
Fargate supports both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS architecture and provides workload isolation and improved security by design.
