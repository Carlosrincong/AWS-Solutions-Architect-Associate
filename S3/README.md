# Blob Storage
In object storage, data is stored as objects in buckets.
Objects are treated as a single, distinct unit of data when stored. 
Each object contains a unique identifier. This identifier, along with any additional metadata, is bundled with the data and stored.
Changing just one character in an object is more difficult than with block storage. When you want to change one character in an object, the entire object must be updated.

### Use Case
you can store almost any type of data, and there is no limit to the number of objects stored, which makes it readily scalable. Object storage is generally useful when storing large or unstructured data sets.
- Data archiving: long-term data retention
- Backup and recovery: replicate content so that if a physical device fails
- Rich media: By using storage classes and replication features, you can create cost-effective, globally replicated architecture to deliver media to distributed users.
