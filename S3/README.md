# Blob Storage
In object storage, data is stored as objects in buckets.
Objects are treated as a single, distinct unit of data when stored. 
Each object contains a unique identifier. This identifier, along with any additional metadata, is bundled with the data and stored.
Changing just one character in an object is more difficult than with block storage. When you want to change one character in an object, the entire object must be updated.

### Use Case
you can store almost any type of data, and there is no limit to the number of objects stored, which makes it readily scalable. Object storage is generally useful when storing large or unstructured data sets.
- Data archiving: long-term data retention
- Backup and recovery: replicate content so that if a physical device fails
- Rich media: By using storage classes and replication features, you can create cost-effective, globally replicated architecture to deliver media to distributed users.

# Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

you can retrieve your data from anywhere on the web.
Object storage stores data in a flat structure. An object is a file combined with metadata.
S3 is highly available with data replication across availability zones
Each bucket name must be unique across all AWS accounts in all AWS Regions within a partition
The object key (key name) uniquely identifies the object in an Amazon S3 bucket. 

Use case:
- Backup and storage: back up files because it is highly redundant
- media hosting: ideal location to host video, photo, and music uploads.
- Software delivery: host your software applications that customers can download.
- Data lakes: because of its virtually unlimited scalability
- Static website and content: host a static website and static content

Security:
- Amazon S3 is private by default.
- You can choose to make your buckets and objects public. 
- Controlled access (with access policy):
    - IAM Policy: which are attached to resources and users
    - S3 bucket policies: This can only be attached to S3 buckets. S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied on the bucket.
    - Encryption: Amazon S3 reinforces encryption in transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and at rest.

Storage Classes
Amazon S3 storage classes let you change your storage tier when your data characteristics change.
- Standard: this is the default storage class. general-purpose storage
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Amazon S3 monitors access patterns of your data and automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on frequency of access. There are three tiers: a frequent access tier, an infrequent access tier, and an archive instance access tier.
- Standard-Infrequent Access: data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed
- One Zone-Infrequent Access: lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA
- Glacier Instant Retrieval: archiving data that is rarely accessed and requires millisecond retrieval
- Glacier Flexible Retrieval: archived data that is accessed 1â€“2 times per year and retrieved in minutes.
- Glacier Deep Archive: lowest-cost Amazon S3 storage class. Data accessed once or twice a year with a retrieval time of 12 hours
- S3 on Outposts: Amazon S3 on Outposts delivers object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts environment using S3 API's and features


Versioning
Without Amazon S3 versioning, every time you upload an object with the same name to the bucket, it will overwrite the original object.
Versioning keeps multiple versions of a single object in the same bucket. 
Versioning helps with object recovery from accidental deletions, accidental overwrites, or application failures.
To reduce your Amazon S3 bill, you might want to delete previous versions of your objects when they are no longer needed.
Buckets can be in one of three states:
- Unversioned (default)
- Versioning-enable: After you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state
- Versioning-suspended: Versioning is suspended for new objects.

Amazon S3 lifecycle.
You can choose to automate between two types of actions: transition (to another storage class) and expiration (deleted).
