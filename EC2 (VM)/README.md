# EC2
Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. With this service, you can provision virtual servers called EC2 instances. 

For high availability, consider using at least two EC2 instances in two separate Availability Zones.

You must define the following: 
- Hardware specifications: 
    - Instance type: CPU, Memory and GPU (optional). Instance families: General purpose, Compute optimized, Memory optimized, Accelerated computing, Storage optimized and HPC optimized.
    - network (VPC)
    - storage (EBS Volume and Lifecycle Manager)
- Logical configurations: 
    - Networking location (VPC)
    - firewall rules (Security Group)
    - authentication (Key Pairs)
    - operating system (AMI)

# Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
EC2 instances are live instantiations (or versions) of what is defined in an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
you can create an AMI from your running instance and use the AMI to start a new instance.

AMIs can comes from:
- AMIs created by AWS
- AWS Marketplace AMIs from third-party vendors
- AMIs are created from your EC2 instances.
- Community AMIs are provided by the AWS user community
- Build your own custom image with EC2 Image Builder

# Pricing
We recommend Savings Plans over Reserved Instances

- On-Demand instances: only pay the specified hourly rates for the instance that you use.
- Spot instances: Users with fault-tolerant or stateless workloads    
- Saving plans:  low usage prices for a 1-year or 3-year term commitment to a consistent amount of usage
- Reserved instances
- Dedicated hosts

## Availability

To increase availability, you need redundancy. This typically means more infrastructureâ€”more data centers, more servers, more databases, and more replication of data. 


High availability involves the following challenges:
- Replication process: replicate the configuration files, software patches, and application across instances. The best method is to automate where you can.
- Customer redirection:  The most common is using a Domain Name System (DNS) where the client uses one record that points to the IP address of all available servers. Another option is to use a load balancer, which takes care of health checks and distributing the load across each server.
- Types of high availability
    - active-passive: only one of the two instances is available at a time. One advantage of this method is that for stateful applications 
    - active-active: A disadvantage of an active-passive system is scalability. Both servers are available, the second server can take some load for the application, and the entire system can take more load. Stateless applications work better for active-active systems.
